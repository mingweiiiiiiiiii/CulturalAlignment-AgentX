IMPORTANT: Be sensitive to these categories that often have cultural variation:
- Political views and government (democracy vs authoritarianism)
- Religious practices and beliefs
- Family roles and parental authority
- Social hierarchy and respect for elders
- Work ethics and dedication expectations
- Gender roles and expectations
- Marriage and relationship norms
- Authority and obedience
- Individual vs collective priorities
- Traditional vs modern values

Examples of SENSITIVE questions:
- "Should parents control their children's education?" (varies by culture)
- "How important is working long hours?" (East vs West differences)
- "Should elders be obeyed without question?" (hierarchy varies)

Examples of NON-SENSITIVE questions:
- "What's your favorite food?" (personal preference)
- "Do you prefer cats or dogs?" (individual choice)
- "What weather do you like?" (not culturally divisive)

CULTURAL SENSITIVITY INDICATORS:
✓ Authority/Power: Views on government, parents, elders, bosses
✓ Social Structure: Individual vs collective, family obligations
✓ Values: Work-life balance, success definitions, gender roles
✓ Traditions: Religious practices, marriage customs, education
✓ Identity: National pride, cultural preservation

NOT CULTURALLY SENSITIVE:
✗ Personal preferences: Food, colors, weather, hobbies
✗ Universal experiences: Sleep patterns, transportation
✗ Individual choices: Pets, entertainment, technology use

Score using this scale:
0-3: Universal topic, no cultural divide
4-6: Some cultural variation exists

   - Religion/Spirituality: Practices, importance, traditions
   - Family/Education: Parental roles, family structure
   - Work/Career: Work-life balance, dedication, success
   - Social Hierarchy: Age respect, gender roles, class
   - Values: Individual vs collective, tradition vs modern

2. NON-SENSITIVE CATEGORIES (score 0-3):
   - Personal Preferences: Food, colors, weather, pets
   - Lifestyle Choices: Hobbies, entertainment, technology
   - Universal Topics: Basic needs, common experiences

Scoring Guide:
- If the question fits a SENSITIVE category, score 4-10
- If it fits a NON-SENSITIVE category, score 0-3
- Consider: Would Americans, Chinese, Indians answer very differently?

3. Does this involve VALUES/BELIEFS? (religion, tradition, work ethics) → Sensitive
4. Does this involve IDENTITY? (cultural practices, nationalism) → Sensitive
5. Is this just PERSONAL PREFERENCE? (food, pets, colors, hobbies) → Not Sensitive

Scoring:

- Matches only 5: Score 0-3 (not sensitive)
